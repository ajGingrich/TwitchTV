# Use the Twitchtv JSON API

Objective 
------

Build an Intermediate Front End Development Project for the freeCodeCamp Curriculum. 
The full description is here: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api

User Stories
------

* I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
* I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
* If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
* I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
